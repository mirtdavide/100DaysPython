#Simple program that generates a band name using information given by the user
#The program asks the city the user grew up in, their pet's name and it generates a band name based on those
#So basically it will save the names in two different variables and it will combine them together in the final print

print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
city_name=input("What's the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
pet_name=input("What's your pet's name?\n")
print("Your band name could be " + city_name + " " + pet_name)
